## Overview

The Employee Directory app allows users to view non-sensitive data about company employees by either filtering their details in the search bar or sorting the respective column headers. 

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
